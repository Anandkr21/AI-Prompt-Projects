The canteen of Mumbai University, known as "Mumbai Munchies", is the heart of the university, beating with the laughter and conversations of students. As an aspiring Python programmer and a proud student of Mumbai University, you've decided to automate the canteen system to make the life of canteen staff easier and services faster.

Objective: Using the basics of Python programming, you will create a command-line application to manage the snack inventory of the canteen and keep track of the sales.

### **Task Details:**

1. **Snack Inventory**: Your application should allow the canteen staff to manage their inventory of snacks. Each snack will have unique attributes, such as snack ID, snack name, price, and availability (yes or no).
2. **User Interaction**: The canteen staff should be able to perform the following tasks:
    - Add a snack to the inventory.
    - Remove a snack from the inventory.
    - Update the availability of a snack.
3. **Sales Records**: The application should also keep a track of the snacks sold. Staff should be able to enter the snack's ID when a sale is made and the application should update the inventory and sales record.
4. **Error Handling**: The application should handle invalid inputs and edge cases, such as selling a snack that is unavailable.

### **Learning Outcomes:**

This assignment will help you to get familiar with Python's core concepts, such as:

1. Variables and data types: Used to store information such as the inventory and sales record.
2. Conditional statements: Used to handle different user inputs and error situations.
3. Loops: Used for tasks like displaying the inventory and sales record.
4. Lists and dictionaries: Used to organize the snack inventory and sales record.
5. Functions: Used to break the code into smaller, manageable pieces.

The solution to this assignment will serve as the foundation for the "Zomato Chronicles: The Great Food Fiasco" assignment. While this assignment focuses on a smaller inventory system and doesn't involve some of the complexities like order management, it introduces the basic operations and error handling that will be necessary for the next assignment.

### Ensure the following things :

1. Functionality: Does the application behave as expected and adhere to the task requirements?
2. Code Style: Is the code well-structured into functions? Is the code easy to read and understand?
3. Error Handling: Does the application handle invalid user input gracefully and prevent illegal actions like selling unavailable snacks?

Good luck! With this assignment, you will be one step closer to automating the operations of Zesty Zomato.
