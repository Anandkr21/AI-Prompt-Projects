### **Problem 1:**

Create a simple Flask application with the following specifications:

- It should have at least three routes: **`/`**, **`/greet/<username>`**, and **`/farewell/<username>`**.
- 
    - **`/`** should display a welcome message.
    - **`/greet/<username>`** should display a greeting message for the user specified in **`<username>`**. For example, if you navigate to **`/greet/John`**, it should display "Hello, John!".
    - **`/farewell/<username>`** should display a farewell message for the user specified in **`<username>`**. For example, if you navigate to **`/farewell/John`**, it should display "Goodbye, John!".



### **Problem 2:**

Create a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application without using a database:

- It should have the following routes: **`/create`**, **`/read`**, **`/update`**, **`/delete`**.
    - **`/create`** should be a form where the user can input data to create a new entry in a Python dictionary.
    - **`/read`** should display the current state of the dictionary.
    - **`/update`** should be a form where the user can update the value of an existing entry in the dictionary.
    - **`/delete`** should be a form where the user can delete an existing entry from the dictionary.

For both applications, you can use any design and layout. The goal is to get comfortable with Flask and understand how it works.

Remember, do not ask ChatGPT for the final code. Instead, use it to understand concepts, debug errors, or get suggestions on how you can solve particular problems.
